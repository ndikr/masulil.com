This role introduced me to agile methodologies, particularly the Scrum process, where I actively participated in weekly sprint planning and architectural meetings. These meetings were crucial in ensuring the scalability and forward compatibility of our systems. <br/> During my tenure, I gained proficiency in utilizing Ngrok to establish secure connections to our test environments, enhancing our development and testing workflows. I also learned to use Sentinel for monitoring and troubleshooting in a microservices architecture, which significantly improved our service reliability and issue resolution speed."

One notable project I led increased operational efficiency by 66%, enabling one person to perform the work previously done by three. <br/> The development process for each project began with comprehensive information gathering from employees and managers. This data was used to construct detailed flowcharts and mockups, which were validated by stakeholders before proceeding. I then outlined the final designs and system architecture. The implementation phase involved developing the backend with Node.js and crafting the frontend with pure JavaScript to ensure compatibility with the existing system architecture."

I engineered a backend system using Node.js that seamlessly integrated with our CRM, leveraging Monday.com's GraphQL API. This system automated the addition of leads to the CRM and facilitated communication by sending emails and text messages through third-party software."
